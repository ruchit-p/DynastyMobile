**Key Findings:**

- **Feature Gap**: 70% of advanced mobile features are missing from web
- **Security Gap**: Enterprise vs. basic security implementation
- **Architecture Gap**: 25+ mobile services vs. 7 web services
- **Capability Gap**: Offline-first vs. online-dependent design

**Strategic Recommendation**:
The web platform requires significant enhancement to achieve feature parity, particularly in security, encryption, and offline capabilities. Consider implementing features in phases based on user needs and security requirements.
