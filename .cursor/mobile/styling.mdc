# Dynasty Mobile Cursor Styling Guide

This document outlines cursor styling rules for web implementations of the Dynasty Mobile app to ensure consistency with the mobile design system.

## Design System Integration

These cursor rules are designed to complement the Dynasty design system which includes:

- **Color Palette:** Primarily using Dynasty green (`#1A4B44`) and its variants
- **Typography:** Helvetica Neue with consistent sizing and weight scales
- **Spacing:** Consistent spacing scale from xxs (2px) to 5xl (80px)
- **Components:** Themed components that adapt to light/dark mode

## Cursor Styling Rules

### Interactive Elements

| Element Type | Cursor Style | Example Components |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Buttons | `pointer` | Button, IconButton |
| Links | `pointer` | ThemedText with variant="link" |
| Form Controls | `pointer` | Checkboxes, radio buttons, switches |
| Menu Items | `pointer` | FloatingActionMenu items, AnimatedActionSheet actions |
| Icons (interactive) | `pointer` | Icons inside TouchableOpacity |
| Draggable Elements | `grab` / `grabbing` | Profile picture during upload/crop |
| Text Fields | `text` | Input fields, TextAreas |
| Disabled Elements | `not-allowed` | Disabled buttons, form elements |

### Non-Interactive Elements

| Element Type | Cursor Style | Example Components |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Text Content | `default` | ThemedText (non-link variants) |
| Images (non-interactive) | `default` | Static images, avatars (when not clickable) |
| Containers | `default` | ThemedView, Card (when not clickable) |
| Loading States | `wait` | During API calls, data loading |

### Custom Cursor States

For web implementations, consider these specialized cursor states to improve UX:

| Interaction | Cursor Style | When to Use |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Family Tree Manipulation | `grab` / `grabbing` | When panning or moving the family tree |
| Media Selection | `pointer` | When selecting media items in vault |
| Audio Recording/Playing | `pointer` | For audio controls |
| Text Selection | `text` | When selecting text in stories or messages |
## Implementation Notes

1. **Touch vs. Cursor:** Remember that mobile uses touch interactions, so cursor styles only apply to web interfaces
2. **Consistency:** Maintain consistent cursor feedback across similar interactive elements
3. **Accessibility:** Ensure cursor styles enhance rather than hinder accessibility
4. **Theme Awareness:** Consider different cursor visibility against light/dark backgrounds

## Component-Specific Rules

### Button Component

```css
.dynasty-button {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.dynasty-button:disabled {
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

### ActionSheet/Menu Components

```css
.dynasty-action-item {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.dynasty-action-item.disabled {
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

### Form Controls

```css
.dynasty-input {
  cursor: text;
}

.dynasty-checkbox,
.dynasty-radio,
.dynasty-switch {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Family Tree

```css
.dynasty-family-tree-container {
  cursor: grab;
}

.dynasty-family-tree-container:active {
  cursor: grabbing;
}

.dynasty-family-node {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

## Integration with Dynasty Color System

When implementing hover and active states, use the design system colors:

- **Hover states:** Consider using lighter variants (e.g., dynastyGreen.medium)
- **Active states:** Consider using darker variants (e.g., dynastyGreen.dark)
- **Focus rings:** Use dynastyGreen.medium with appropriate opacity

These cursor rules should be applied consistently across web implementations to maintain the look and feel of the Dynasty Mobile design system.
