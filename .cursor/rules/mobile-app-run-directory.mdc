# Mobile App Execution Directory

To run the Dynasty Mobile application, you **MUST** navigate to the `apps/mobile` directory first.

All commands related to running, building, or serving the mobile app (e.g., `expo start`, `yarn ios`, `yarn android`) should be executed from within the `[apps/mobile/](mdc:apps/mobile)` directory.

*Rationale*: The mobile project is configured to run from this specific subdirectory, and running commands from the workspace root or other locations may lead to build failures or unexpected behavior.
