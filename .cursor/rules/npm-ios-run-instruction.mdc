# NPM Run iOS Execution Directory

This rule specifies the correct directory for executing the `npm run ios` command.

## Directory Requirement

You **MUST** navigate to the `apps/mobile` directory before running the `npm run ios` command.

All commands related to building and running the iOS application via `npm run ios` should be executed from within the `[apps/mobile/](mdc:apps/mobile)` directory.

## Rationale

The mobile application's build process, particularly when using `npm run ios`, is configured to operate from the `apps/mobile` subdirectory. Attempting to run this command from the workspace root or any other location is likely to result in build failures or other unexpected behavior.
