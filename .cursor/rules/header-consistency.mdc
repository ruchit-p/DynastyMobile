# Header Consistency Rules

This document outlines the rules for implementing consistent headers across the Dynasty Mobile application. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure a uniform user experience.

## 1. Header Component Usage

- **Centralized Header Component**: If a common header component exists (e.g., `apps/mobile/components/ui/AppHeader.tsx` or similar), it **MUST** be used for all screens that require a standard header.
    - *Rationale*: Promotes reusability and ensures that updates to header style or functionality are applied globally.
- **Custom Headers**: If a screen requires a significantly different header, the reasons **MUST** be documented, and efforts should be made to incorporate common elements (like title styling, back button behavior) from the standard header.

## 2. Header Title

- **Font and Styling**: Header titles should use a consistent font family, size, and weight. Font definitions and typography guidelines are specified in `[styling-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/styling-guidelines.mdc)` and utilize constants from `[apps/mobile/constants/Fonts.ts](mdc:apps/mobile/constants/Fonts.ts)` and `[apps/mobile/constants/Typography.ts](mdc:apps/mobile/constants/Typography.ts)`.
- **Capitalization**: Use title case for header titles (e.g., "User Profile", "Settings Page").
- **Length**: Keep titles concise and descriptive. Avoid overly long titles that might truncate on smaller screens.

## 3. Navigation Elements

- **Back Button**:
    - A consistent back button icon and behavior **MUST** be used.
    - It should typically be present on the left side of the header for screens that are not top-level tabs.
- **Action Buttons**:
    - Icons for common actions (e.g., settings, add, search) should be consistent across the app.
    - Placement of action buttons (usually on the right) should be uniform.
    - Limit the number of action buttons in the header to avoid clutter.

## 4. Styling

- **Background Color**: Header background color should be consistent, primarily derived from `[apps/mobile/constants/Colors.ts](mdc:apps/mobile/constants/Colors.ts)`. Other general theming aspects might be influenced by files within the `[apps/mobile/constants/](mdc:apps/mobile/constants)` directory.
- **Border/Shadow**: If headers use a bottom border or shadow, this style should be applied uniformly, with relevant values (like spacing or color) also sourced from the `[apps/mobile/constants/](mdc:apps/mobile/constants)` directory (e.g., `Spacing.ts`, `Colors.ts`).

## 5. Accessibility

- **Readable Text**: Ensure sufficient contrast between header text and background.
- **Touchable Area**: Navigation icons and action buttons must have an adequate touchable area.

## Example File Structure References:

- Check for a centralized header component in: `[components/ui/](mdc:apps/mobile/components/ui)`
- Refer to theme/constants in: `[constants/](mdc:apps/mobile/constants)`
- Observe header usage in screen files: `[app/(screens)/](mdc:apps/mobile/app/(screens)/)` and `[app/(tabs)/](mdc:apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/)`
