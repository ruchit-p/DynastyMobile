**Firebase Functions**:
```typescript
// Server-side key generation (recommended)
generateUserKeys({ password, keyFormat: "pem"|"der" })

// Client-side key storage (mobile app)
storeClientGeneratedKeys({ identityKey, signingKey, keyFormat })

// Check encryption status
getEncryptionStatus() // Returns compatibility flags

// Initialize encrypted chat
initializeEncryptedChat({ participantIds, groupName })

// Send encrypted messages
sendMessage({ chatId, content, type, encryptedContent })
```

**Key Storage Locations**:
- `/users/{userId}` - Public keys in PEM format
