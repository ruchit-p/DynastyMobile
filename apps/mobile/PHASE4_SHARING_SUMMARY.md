# Phase 4: Family Vault Sharing - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 4 implements secure file sharing between family members using end-to-end encryption. This allows users to share encrypted vault files while maintaining zero-knowledge security.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. FamilyVaultSharing Service (`FamilyVaultSharing.ts`)
- **Key Wrapping**: Uses libsodium's `crypto_box` for secure key exchange
- **Per-File Keys**: Each shared file maintains its own encryption key
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions (read/write/reshare)
- **Share Management**: Create, accept, revoke shares with proper notifications
- **Expiration**: Automatic share expiry with configurable duration
- **Bulk Operations**: Share multiple files with multiple recipients

### 2. VaultService Integration
- **Share Methods**: 
  - `shareVaultFile()` - Share files with family members
  - `acceptSharedFile()` - Accept incoming shares
  - `revokeSharedFile()` - Revoke existing shares
  - `getSharedFiles()` - List shared files
  - `getFileShares()` - Get shares for a specific file
  - `getSharingStats()` - Get sharing statistics

- **Access Control**: 
  - `hasFileAccess()` - Check if user has access to a file
  - `getFileKeyForAccess()` - Retrieve file key for owned or shared files
  - `getItemsWithShared()` - List vault items including shared files

## Technical Architecture

### Security Model
```
Owner's Vault                    Recipient's Vault
    |                                  |
File Key (AES-256)                     |
    |                                  |
    v                                  |
crypto_box_easy() <--- Recipient's Public Key
    |                                  |
    v                                  |
Encrypted File Key -----------------> crypto_box_open_easy()
                                          |
                                          v
                                    File Key (AES-256)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Sharing Process**:
   - Owner generates/retrieves file encryption key
   - Key is wrapped using recipient's public key (crypto_box)
   - Share record created in Firestore with encrypted key
   - Notification sent to recipient

2. **Acceptance Process**:
   - Recipient retrieves share record
   - Decrypts file key using their private key
   - Share status updated to 'active'
   - Access record created for permission checks

3. **Access Process**:
   - VaultService checks if user owns file or has active share
   - Appropriate file key retrieved (generated or decrypted from share)
   - File decrypted using standard vault decryption

### Database Schema
```typescript
// vault_shares collection
interface VaultShare {
  id: string;
  fileId: string;
  ownerId: string;
  recipientId: string;
  permissions: {
    read: boolean;
    write: boolean;
    reshare: boolean;
  };
  encryptedFileKey: {
    ciphertext: string; // Base64 encoded
    nonce: string; // Base64 encoded
    senderPublicKey: string; // Base64 encoded
  };
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'revoked' | 'expired';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  expiresAt?: Timestamp;
  acceptedAt?: Timestamp;
  revokedAt?: Timestamp;
  metadata?: {
    fileName?: string;
    fileSize?: number;
    message?: string;
  };
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Management
- Each user has a unique key pair for sharing (X25519)
- Public keys are published to user profiles
- Private keys stored securely with vault keys
- Key rotation supported independently from vault master key

### Permission System
- **Read**: Can download and decrypt the file
- **Write**: Can modify the file (future feature)
- **Reshare**: Can share the file with others (future feature)

### Share Lifecycle
1. **Pending**: Share created, awaiting acceptance
2. **Active**: Share accepted, access granted
3. **Expired**: Share past expiration date
4. **Revoked**: Share manually revoked by owner

### Security Considerations
- Zero-knowledge: Server never sees unencrypted file keys
- Forward secrecy: Revoking share prevents future access
- No key escrow: Lost keys cannot be recovered
- Audit trail: All sharing activities logged

## Usage Examples

### Share a File
```typescript
const result = await vaultService.shareVaultFile(
  fileId,
  ['recipient-user-id'],
  { read: true, write: false },
  {
    expiryDays: 30,
    message: 'Please review this document'
  }
);
```

### Accept a Share
```typescript
const result = await vaultService.acceptSharedFile(shareId);
if (result.success) {
  // File now accessible via getItemsWithShared()
}
```

### List Shared Files
```typescript
// Files shared with me
const sharedWithMe = await vaultService.getSharedFiles('shared-with-me');

// Files I've shared
const sharedByMe = await vaultService.getSharedFiles('shared-by-me');
```

### Download Shared File
```typescript
// Download works transparently for owned and shared files
const localPath = await vaultService.downloadFile(sharedItem);
```

## Testing
- Created `test-vault-sharing.ts` for comprehensive testing
- Tests cover: sharing, accepting, revoking, listing, and access control
- Mock data used to simulate sharing scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 5: Social Recovery
1. **Shamir's Secret Sharing**: Split vault key among trusted family members
2. **Recovery Threshold**: Require M of N members to recover access
3. **Recovery UI**: Guide users through recovery process
4. **Trust Management**: Add/remove recovery trustees

### Additional Features
1. **Folder Sharing**: Share entire folders with automatic inheritance
2. **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time collaboration on shared documents
3. **Share Templates**: Predefined permission sets for common scenarios
4. **Share Analytics**: Track share usage and access patterns
5. **External Sharing**: Share with users outside the family (via link)

## Files Modified/Created

  - Added sharing service integration
  - Added share management methods
  - Enhanced download to support shared files
  - Added access control checks

## Security Audit Checklist
- [x] Zero-knowledge encryption maintained
- [x] Proper key derivation and wrapping
- [x] Access control enforcement
- [x] Share expiration handling
- [x] Revocation immediately effective
- [x] Audit logging for all operations
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Error handling without information leakage

## Performance Considerations
- Share operations are lightweight (only key wrapping)
- Bulk sharing optimized with parallel operations
- Caching for active shares to reduce database queries
- Lazy loading of shared file metadata

## Conclusion
Phase 4 successfully implements secure file sharing for the Dynasty vault. The implementation maintains zero-knowledge security while providing a seamless sharing experience. Users can now safely share encrypted files with family members with granular access control and full auditability.
