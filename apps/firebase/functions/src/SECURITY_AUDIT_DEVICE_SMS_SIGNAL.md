# Security Audit: Device Fingerprint, SMS, and Signal Protocol Functions

## Date: 2025-01-28

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Device Fingerprinting

#### Issues Found:
- ❌ **Privacy Issue**: Storing actual IP addresses without hashing/encryption
- ❌ **Privacy Issue**: Storing exact GPS coordinates in auth events
- ❌ **Security Issue**: No rate limiting on fingerprint verification requests
- ❌ **Security Issue**: Potential for device fingerprint exhaustion attacks

#### Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Added IP address hashing using SHA-256 with salt
- ✅ Removed GPS coordinates from auth event logs, only storing city/country
- ✅ Added rate limiting (5 requests per minute) for fingerprint verification
- ✅ Added proper anonymization for sensitive data in logs

### 2. Signal Protocol Implementation

#### Issues Found:
- ❌ **Critical Security**: Using basic HTML tag removal for cryptographic key "sanitization"
- ❌ **Security Issue**: No validation of key format/structure (Base64, length, etc.)
- ❌ **Security Issue**: No rate limiting on prekey consumption (exhaustion attack vector)
- ❌ **Security Issue**: Key change notifications don't invalidate existing sessions
- ❌ **Availability Issue**: cleanupOldPreKeys could delete all prekeys without ensuring minimum remain
- ❌ **Security Issue**: No mechanism to force re-verification after key changes

#### Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Replaced sanitizeInput with validateCryptoKey that validates Base64 encoding and length
- ✅ Added rate limiting for getUserSignalBundle (10 requests per hour per user pair)
- ✅ Added prekey count monitoring with notifications when < 10 prekeys remain
- ✅ Updated cleanupOldPreKeys to maintain minimum 20 prekeys per device
- ✅ Enhanced notifyKeyChange to:
  - Mark trusted identities as untrusted
  - Create high-priority security notifications
  - Invalidate existing sessions

### 3. SMS/Twilio Integration

#### Issues Found:
- ❌ **Critical Issue**: Missing import for `logger` causing runtime crash
- ❌ **Critical Issue**: Undefined `twilioAuthToken` variable
- ❌ **Security Issue**: URL construction from headers vulnerable to header injection
- ❌ **Security Issue**: No IP whitelist for Twilio webhooks
- ❌ **Security Issue**: No replay attack protection (nonce/timestamp validation)
- ❌ **Issue**: Dynamic import of twilio library may fail

#### Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Added missing imports for logger and twilioAuthToken
- ✅ Added host header validation with regex to prevent injection
- ✅ Sanitized protocol header to only allow http/https

### 4. General Security Improvements

#### Key Management:
- ✅ Added proper cryptographic key validation
- ✅ Implemented key versioning through proper tracking
- ✅ Added compromise detection through key change notifications

#### Privacy:
- ✅ IP addresses are now hashed before storage
- ✅ GPS coordinates excluded from logs
- ✅ Sensitive location data minimized to city/country level

#### Rate Limiting:
- ✅ Device fingerprint verification: 5 per minute
- ✅ Signal prekey requests: 10 per hour per user pair
- ✅ SMS verification already had rate limiting in place

## Remaining Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. **Twilio Webhook Security**: Implement IP whitelist for Twilio's IP ranges
2. **Signal Key Storage**: Encrypt Signal protocol keys at rest in Firestore
3. **Replay Protection**: Add timestamp/nonce validation for Twilio webhooks
4. **IP Hash Salt**: Move IP hash salt to Firebase secrets/config

### Medium Priority:
1. **Key Rotation**: Implement automatic key rotation for Signal protocol
2. **Session Management**: Add session invalidation API for compromised devices
3. **Audit Trail**: Enhance audit logging for all security-critical operations
4. **Zero-Knowledge**: Consider implementing zero-knowledge proofs for key verification

### Low Priority:
1. **Monitoring**: Add alerting for suspicious patterns (rapid key changes, etc.)
2. **Documentation**: Document the security model and threat assumptions
3. **Testing**: Add security-focused integration tests

## Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Added proper error handling
- Improved type safety
- Enhanced logging for security events
