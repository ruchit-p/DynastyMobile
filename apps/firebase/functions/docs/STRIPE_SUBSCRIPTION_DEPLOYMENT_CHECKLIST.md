## üöÄ Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure (Day 1)

```bash
# 1. Initialize migration tracking
firebase functions:shell
> const {SubscriptionMigrationService} = require('./lib/services/subscriptionMigrationService');
> const service = new SubscriptionMigrationService();
> await service.initializeMigration();
> .exit

# 2. Deploy subscription functions (without webhook activation)
firebase deploy --only functions:createCheckoutSession,functions:getSubscriptionStatus,functions:cancelSubscription,functions:updateSubscription,functions:reactivateSubscription,functions:createCustomerPortalSession,functions:getAvailableAddons --project production

# 3. Verify deployment
firebase functions:log --project production
```

### Phase 2: User Data Migration (Day 2-3)

```bash
# 1. Run migration in dry-run mode
npm run migrate:subscription-fields:dry

# 2. Review migration report
# Check logs for any issues

# 3. Execute migration in batches
npm run migrate:subscription-fields:execute -- --batch-size=100

# 4. Verify migration status
firebase functions:shell
> const service = new SubscriptionMigrationService();
> const report = await service.generateMigrationReport();
> console.log(report);
```

### Phase 3: Webhook Activation (Day 4)

```bash
# 1. Deploy webhook handler (inactive)
firebase deploy --only functions:handleStripeWebhook --project production

# 2. Test webhook with Stripe CLI
stripe listen --forward-to https://your-domain/api/webhooks/stripe

# 3. Send test events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded

# 4. Activate webhook in Stripe Dashboard
# Add webhook endpoint URL and signing secret
```

### Phase 4: Frontend Deployment (Day 5)

```bash
# 1. Deploy web app to staging
cd apps/web/dynastyweb
npm run build
vercel --prod=false

# 2. Test all flows in staging
# - Pricing page
# - Checkout flow
# - Subscription management
# - Cancellation flow

# 3. Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Phase 5: Internal Testing (Day 6-7)

- [ ] Create test accounts with different subscription types
- [ ] Test upgrade/downgrade flows
- [ ] Test cancellation and reactivation
- [ ] Test family plan invitations
- [ ] Test addon purchases
- [ ] Test billing portal access
- [ ] Verify email notifications

### Phase 6: Gradual Rollout (Week 2)

```bash
# 1. Enable for 10% of users
firebase functions:shell
> const service = new SubscriptionMigrationService();
> await service.updateRolloutPercentage(10);
> await service.updateMigrationPhase('PARTIAL_ROLLOUT');

# 2. Monitor for 24 hours
# Check error logs, user feedback

# 3. Increase to 25%
> await service.updateRolloutPercentage(25);

# 4. Increase to 50%
> await service.updateRolloutPercentage(50);

# 5. Full rollout
> await service.updateRolloutPercentage(100);
> await service.updateMigrationPhase('FULL_ROLLOUT');
```

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-subscriptions.sh

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Starting emergency rollback..."

# 1. Disable webhooks in Stripe Dashboard
echo "ACTION REQUIRED: Disable webhook in Stripe Dashboard"
read -p "Press enter when webhook is disabled..."

# 2. Set rollout to 0%
firebase functions:shell --project production << EOF
const service = new SubscriptionMigrationService();
await service.updateRolloutPercentage(0);
await service.updateMigrationPhase('ROLLED_BACK');
.exit
EOF

# 3. Deploy previous function version
firebase functions:delete handleStripeWebhook --project production --force

# 4. Restore user data from snapshots
node scripts/restore-user-snapshots.js

echo "‚úÖ Rollback complete"
```

### User-Specific Rollback
```javascript
// In Firebase Functions shell
const service = new SubscriptionMigrationService();
const snapshotId = "snapshot_id_here";
await service.rollbackUserMigration("user_id", snapshotId);
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Webhook Success Rate**
   ```

   Alert: > 5% over 30 minutes
   ```

### Logging Queries
```sql
-- Failed webhook events
SELECT timestamp, error_message
FROM logs
WHERE function_name = 'handleStripeWebhook'
  AND severity = 'ERROR'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Subscription creation failures
SELECT user_id, error_message, timestamp
FROM logs
