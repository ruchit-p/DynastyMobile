# Vault Encryption Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Dynasty Vault now features a zero-knowledge encryption architecture using XChaCha20-Poly1305, ensuring that files are encrypted client-side and the server never has access to unencrypted content or encryption keys.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Phase 1: Core Encryption Infrastructure ✅
- **Encryption Service**: Implemented using libsodium's XChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Salt Management**: 32-byte random salts per encryption operation
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens on the client before upload

### Phase 2: Vault API Functions ✅
All vault functions implemented with proper authentication and rate limiting:
- `getVaultItems` - List user's vault items
- `addVaultFile` - Upload encrypted files
- `createVaultFolder` - Create folder structure
- `renameVaultItem` - Rename files/folders
- `deleteVaultItem` - Soft delete with 30-day retention
- `moveVaultItem` - Move items between folders
- `shareVaultItem` - Share with family members
- `getVaultDownloadUrl` - Generate secure download URLs
- `createVaultShareLink` - Create time-limited share links
- `accessVaultShareLink` - Access shared items
- `getVaultAuditLogs` - View audit history

### Phase 3: Cloudflare R2 Integration ✅
- **Storage Backend**: Migrated from Firebase Storage to Cloudflare R2
- **Direct Uploads**: Pre-signed URLs for direct client uploads
- **CORS Configuration**: Separate configs for staging/production
- **Lifecycle Rules**: Automatic cleanup of deleted items after 30 days

### Phase 4: Security Features ✅
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server never sees unencrypted data
- **Client-Side Key Derivation**: Keys derived from user password
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Files encrypted before leaving device
- **Secure Sharing**: Re-encryption for shared access
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ✅
- **Search**: Encrypted metadata allows searching without decryption
- **Version History**: Track file versions with encryption
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk file operations
- **Offline Support**: Queue operations when offline

### Phase 6: Security Hardening ✅
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Based on user trust scores
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation for all inputs
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevent directory escape attacks
- **MIME Type Validation**: Block dangerous file types
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time incident detection and alerting

### Phase 7: Production Deployment ✅
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment with verification
- **Secrets Management**: Secure configuration for all environments
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries for vault operations
- **Security Rules**: Firestore rules protecting vault data
- **Monitoring Setup**: Alerts for errors and security incidents

## Architecture

### Client-Side Components
```typescript
// Key derivation from password
const salt = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));
const key = await deriveKey(password, salt);

// File encryption before upload
const encrypted = await encrypt(fileData, key);
const { presignedUrl } = await getUploadUrl(fileName);
await uploadToR2(presignedUrl, encrypted);
```

### Server-Side Components
- **Authentication**: All functions use `withAuth` middleware
- **Rate Limiting**: Adaptive limits based on operation type
- **Validation**: Input sanitization and validation schemas
- **Audit Logging**: Every operation logged for compliance
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error codes and messages

### Storage Architecture
```
Cloudflare R2 Bucket Structure:
/vault/
  /{userId}/
    /files/
      /{fileId}          # Encrypted file data
    /metadata/
      /{fileId}.json     # Encrypted metadata
    /thumbnails/
      /{fileId}.jpg      # Encrypted thumbnails
/deleted/
  /{timestamp}/
    /{fileId}            # Soft-deleted files (30-day retention)
/shared/
  /{shareId}/
    /{fileId}            # Shared file copies
```

## Security Model

### Threat Protection
1. **Server Compromise**: Zero-knowledge architecture protects data
2. **Man-in-the-Middle**: TLS + additional encryption layer
3. **Brute Force**: Rate limiting + account lockout
4. **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries + input validation
5. **XSS Attacks**: Content Security Policy + sanitization
6. **Path Traversal**: Path normalization + validation

### Compliance Features
- **SOC 2**: Complete audit logging
- **GDPR**: User data export and deletion
- **HIPAA**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Data Residency**: Regional storage options

## Performance Metrics

### Target Performance
- File Upload (< 100MB): < 3s p95
- File Download: < 2s p95
- List Operations: < 500ms p95
- Search Operations: < 1s p95
- Encryption Overhead: < 200ms

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Chunked Uploads**: Large files uploaded in chunks
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple operations in parallel
3. **Caching**: Encrypted metadata cached locally
4. **Compression**: Files compressed before encryption
5. **CDN Integration**: Global edge caching for downloads

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics
- Function error rates
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Rate limit violations
- Storage usage trends
- Security incident frequency

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 5s (p95)
- Security incidents (immediate)
- Storage quota > 80%
- Failed authentication spikes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **WebAuthn Integration**: Biometric authentication
2. **Hardware Key Support**: YubiKey integration
3. **Advanced Sharing**: Granular permissions
4. **Smart Search**: AI-powered encrypted search
5. **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time encrypted collaboration

### Performance Improvements
1. **WebAssembly Crypto**: Faster client-side encryption
2. **Streaming Encryption**: Process large files efficiently
3. **Intelligent Caching**: Predictive cache warming
4. **Edge Computing**: Process at Cloudflare edge
