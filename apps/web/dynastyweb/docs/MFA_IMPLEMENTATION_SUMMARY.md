### 3. MFA Sign-In Modal (`src/components/auth/MfaSignInModal.tsx`)

**✅ Complete MFA Challenge Interface:**

- Automatic modal trigger when MFA is required during sign-in
- Factor selection interface for users with multiple MFA methods
- Code input interface for verification
- Support for both TOTP and SMS verification
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Cancel functionality

**Features:**

- **Factor Selection**: Choose between available MFA methods
- **Code Input**: 6-digit verification code entry
- **Visual Feedback**: Icons and descriptions for each factor type
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and retry options
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation

### 4. Integration Points

**✅ Complete System Integration:**

- Added MFA modal to main app layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Integrated MFA management into privacy/security settings page
- Updated import paths to use enhanced auth context
- Proper component organization and file structure

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase SDK Integration

- **MFA Types**: TOTP (Time-based) and SMS (Phone-based)
- **Security**: Proper RecaptchaVerifier integration for SMS
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive Firebase error catching and user-friendly messages

### TypeScript Support

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all MFA operations
- **Custom Types**: MfaEnrollmentInfo, TotpSetupInfo, MfaChallenge, MfaSignInState
- **Error Types**: Proper typing for Firebase MFA errors

### UI/UX Design

- **Consistent Design**: Uses existing UI component library
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly responsive design
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels
- **User Experience**: Intuitive step-by-step flows

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users

1. **Enable MFA**: Go to Account Settings → Privacy & Security → Multi-Factor Authentication
2. **Choose Method**: Select TOTP (authenticator app) or SMS
3. **Setup**: Follow the step-by-step setup process
4. **Sign In**: Complete MFA challenge when signing in

### For Developers

1. **Import Context**: Use `useAuth()` from `@/context/EnhancedAuthContext`
2. **Access MFA Methods**: All MFA functionality available through context
3. **Handle MFA State**: Monitor `mfaSignInState` for MFA requirements
4. **Custom Integration**: Use individual MFA methods for custom flows

## 🔒 Security Features

- **TOTP Support**: Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
- **SMS Verification**: Phone-based verification with RecaptchaVerifier
- **Multiple Factors**: Users can enroll multiple MFA methods
- **Secure Storage**: All MFA data stored securely in Firebase
- **Error Recovery**: Proper handling of failed attempts and network issues

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing

- Test TOTP setup with authenticator apps
- Test SMS verification with real phone numbers
- Test MFA challenge flow during sign-in
- Test factor removal and re-enrollment
- Test error scenarios (wrong codes, network issues)

### Automated Testing

- Unit tests for MFA context methods
- Integration tests for MFA flows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Error handling test scenarios

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Backup Codes**: Implement one-time backup codes for account recovery
2. **MFA Enforcement**: Admin controls to require MFA for all users
3. **Audit Logging**: Track MFA enrollment/usage events
4. **Advanced Policies**: Time-based MFA requirements, trusted devices
5. **Biometric Support**: WebAuthn/FIDO2 integration for hardware keys
