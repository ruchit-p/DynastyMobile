# Sanitization Updates for Production Security

**Date:** May 26, 2025
**Purpose:** Address critical XSS vulnerabilities by implementing comprehensive input sanitization

## Overview

This document details the sanitization improvements made to the Dynasty Mobile codebase to address the security audit finding: **"No HTML/Script Sanitization: User-generated content stored and displayed without sanitization"**

## Changes Made

### 1. Story Creation & Updates (`app/(screens)/createStory.tsx`)

**Sanitized Fields:**
- Story title (max 200 chars)
- Story subtitle (max 300 chars)
- Location address (max 500 chars)
- Author name (max 100 chars)
- Text blocks within stories (max 5000 chars)
- Audio file names (max 255 chars)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import { sanitizeUserInput, sanitizeForDisplay } from '../../src/lib/xssSanitization';

// Applied to all user inputs before saving to Firestore
title: sanitizeUserInput(storyTitle, { maxLength: 200, trim: true }),
subtitle: sanitizeUserInput(subtitle, { maxLength: 300, trim: true }),
// ... etc
```

### 2. Chat Messages (`src/services/encryption/ChatEncryptionService.ts`)

**Sanitized Fields:**
- Message text content (max 5000 chars)
- Media file names

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Sanitize message before encryption and storage
const sanitizedText = sanitizeUserInput(text, { maxLength: 5000, trim: true });
const sanitizedFileName = sanitizeFilename(fileName);
```

### 3. User Profiles (`app/(screens)/editProfile.tsx`)

**Sanitized Fields:**
- Display name (max 100 chars)
- Email address (validated format)
- Phone number (validated format)
- Gender (max 50 chars)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
displayName: sanitizeUserInput(name, { maxLength: 100, trim: true }),
phoneNumber: sanitizePhoneNumber(phoneNumber),
// Email validation before update
const sanitizedEmail = sanitizeEmail(editableEmail);
```

### 4. Story Display (`components/ui/StoryPost.tsx`)

**Sanitized Fields for Display:**
- Author display name (max 100 chars)
- Story title (max 200 chars)
- Story subtitle (max 300 chars)
- Location address (max 500 chars)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Applied when rendering content to ensure any legacy unsanitized data is safe
{sanitizeForDisplay(story.author?.displayName || story.authorID, 100)}
{sanitizeForDisplay(storyTitle, 200)}
```

### 5. Event Creation (`app/(screens)/createEvent.tsx`)

**Sanitized Fields:**
- Event title (max 200 chars)
- Event description (max 2000 chars)
- Virtual meeting link (URL validation)
- Dress code (max 200 chars)
- What to bring (max 500 chars)
- Location address (max 500 chars)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
title: sanitizeUserInput(newEvent.title, { maxLength: 200, trim: true }),
description: sanitizeUserInput(newEvent.description, { maxLength: 2000, trim: true }),
virtualLink: newEvent.isVirtual ? sanitizeUrl(newEvent.virtualLink) : undefined,
// Location object with sanitized address
location: newEvent.selectedLocation ? {
  address: sanitizeUserInput(newEvent.selectedLocation.address, { maxLength: 500, trim: true }),
  lat: newEvent.selectedLocation.lat,
  lng: newEvent.selectedLocation.lng
} : null
```

## Existing Sanitization Infrastructure

The codebase already included comprehensive sanitization utilities in:
- `src/lib/xssSanitization.ts` - Core sanitization functions
- `src/hooks/useSanitizedInput.ts` - React hook for form inputs

These tools provide:
- HTML entity escaping
- Dangerous tag/attribute removal
- XSS pattern detection
- URL validation
- File name sanitization
- Type-specific sanitization (email, phone, etc.)

## Security Improvements

1. **Prevents Stored XSS**: All user input is sanitized before storage in Firestore
2. **Prevents Reflected XSS**: Display functions sanitize content before rendering
3. **Data Integrity**: Invalid or malicious input is cleaned or rejected
4. **Type Safety**: Specific sanitization for different data types (emails, phones, URLs)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for all sanitization functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test data flow from input → storage → display
3. **Security Tests**: Attempt XSS payloads in all user input fields
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure sanitization doesn't impact app performance

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Backend Validation**: Firebase Functions should also validate/sanitize inputs
2. **Rich Text Content**: If rich text editing is added, use a secure markdown/HTML parser
3. **File Uploads**: Continue using existing file validation and sanitization
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep sanitization patterns updated for new attack vectors

## Conclusion

These updates significantly improve the security posture of the Dynasty Mobile application by ensuring all user-generated content is properly sanitized before storage and display. This addresses the critical XSS vulnerability identified in the security audit while maintaining a good user experience.
