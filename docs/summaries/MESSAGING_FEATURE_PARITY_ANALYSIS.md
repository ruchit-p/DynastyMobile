## Technical Debt

### Mobile
- Some encryption features need iOS parity with Android
- Voice message UI could be improved
- Media compression could be optimized

### Web
- E2EE implementation needs to match mobile security
- Offline support is minimal
- Performance optimization needed for large chats
- Missing many security UI components

## Conclusion

The mobile app has significantly more messaging features, especially around:
- Security (Signal Protocol, biometrics, key verification)
- Performance (FlashList, optimization services)
- Offline support (SQLite, background sync)
- Media handling (native camera, voice messages)

The web app needs substantial work to achieve feature parity, particularly in security features and offline capabilities.
