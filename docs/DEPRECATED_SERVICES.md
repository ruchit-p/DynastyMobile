> Last Updated: January 2025

This document tracks services that have been removed or replaced in the Dynasty codebase.

## üö´ Removed Services

### FingerprintJS (Removed: January 2025)

**What it was:** Device fingerprinting library for identifying unique devices and browsers.

**Why removed:** 
- Privacy concerns with device fingerprinting
- Native device identification methods are sufficient
- Reduced dependency overhead and costs

**What replaced it:**
- Native device properties (`Device.brand`, `Device.modelName`) for mobile
- Browser-based identification for web
- Cryptographic fingerprints for E2EE remain unchanged

**Removed packages:**
- `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs`
- `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react`
- `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react-native`
- `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-server-api`

**Files removed:**
- `FingerprintService.ts`
- `EnhancedFingerprintService.ts`
- `FingerprintProvider.tsx`

### SendGrid (Removed: January 2025)

**What it was:** Email delivery service for transactional emails.

**Why removed:**
- Higher costs compared to AWS SES
- Limited integration with AWS infrastructure
- AWS SES provides better deliverability in our regions

**What replaced it:** AWS SES (Simple Email Service)

**Removed packages:**
- `@sendgrid/mail`

**Deprecated files:**
- `sendgridConfig.deprecated.ts`
- All SendGrid-specific email templates

**Migration notes:**
- All email functions now use `sendEmailUniversal`
- Email templates automatically converted to SES format
- MFA email support added (not available in SendGrid)

## üîÑ Services Being Replaced

### Cloudflare R2 (Transitioning: January 2025)

**Status:** Code still references R2, but transitioning to Backblaze B2

**What it is:** Object storage service for vault files and media.

**Why changing:**
- Backblaze B2 offers more competitive pricing
- Better integration with our backup strategy
- Simplified billing and management

**What's replacing it:** Backblaze B2

**Migration status:**
- Configuration ready for B2
- Same S3-compatible APIs (minimal code changes)
- Bucket names remain the same
- Update `B2_CONFIG` secret to complete migration

## üìã Configuration Updates Required

When removing deprecated services, update these files:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Remove from `.env.example` files
   - Remove from GitHub Secrets
   - Remove from Firebase Secret Manager

2. **Documentation:**
   - Update setup guides
   - Update deployment checklists
   - Update API documentation

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Remove from `package.json`
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update lock files
   - Check for any transitive dependencies

## üîç How to Check for Deprecated Code

```bash
# Search for FingerprintJS references
grep -r "fingerprint" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"

# Search for SendGrid references
grep -r "sendgrid" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"

# Search for R2 references (when transitioning to B2)
grep -r "r2\." --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"
grep -r "cloudflarestorage" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Do not restore deprecated services** unless absolutely necessary
2. **Update all documentation** when removing services
3. **Test thoroughly** after removing dependencies
4. **Keep this file updated** when deprecating new services
